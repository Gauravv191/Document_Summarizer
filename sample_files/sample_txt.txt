Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on building smart machines capable of 
performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, 
problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

There are two types of AI: narrow AI, which is designed for a specific task, and general AI, which can 
perform any intellectual task that a human can do. AI is being used in various sectors like healthcare, 
finance, and transportation to improve efficiency and decision-making.
